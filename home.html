                For the longest time, fireflies were a mainstay of early summer nights 
                in the south and across the United States, twinkling in the sky at dusk 
                in May and June to mark the official start of summer. As you may have noticed, 
                fireflies are disappearing from the sky at an alarming rate. 
                This decline has been observed all over the world, but has been especially prevalent in developing countries.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Human Impact on Fireflies:</strong> Urban development, including increased construction and drained marshes, dries out the environment needed by the larva. 
                Pesticides either kill the larva or kill off its food supply.
            </p>

            <p class="last-p">But together, here in <underline>Savethe<yellow>Fireflies</yellow>Today.org,</underline> we can act as ONE. As a conservation group for insects all over the world,
               we support firefly research and conservation, and to spread the message that fireflies need our help.

                Save the Fireflies Today is a nonprofit organization 
                founded in 2009 by Ben Pfeiffer, a recognized firefly researcher 
                and Texas-certified master naturalist.<br><br>‚ÄúIt was maybe 2008 when I noticed the fireflies in South Texas were disappearing,‚Äù 
                Ben says. ‚ÄúThere weren't as many as I remembered when I was a kid. And then I heard a</p>
                
                <p>
                report on firefly decline on NPR Radio that confirmed it.‚Äù
                Ben was uniquely suited to tackle this problem. He is a 6th generation Texan who grew up 
                exploring the hills of the Texas Hill Country and brush country of South Texas where he developed 
                a deep understanding of the state's unique ecology. Ben is also a beekeeper and certified-naturalist 
                with</p>
                
                <p>Texas Parks & Wildlife. Ben attended Texas State University in San Marcos for a 
                Bachelor of Science in Biology. <br> <br> He combined that with a background in marketing, web development, 
                and SEO to build a website and foundation that would help him and others take action.</p>
